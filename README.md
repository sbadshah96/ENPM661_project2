***dijkstra_shreejay_badshah.py**

This python3 script performs Dijkstra search and planning algorithm on a 600x250 canvas with obstacles

The scripts includes following libraries:
-PriorityQueue (from queue)
-time
-pygame

To run the code, open any editor (preferably VSC) and run the script.

***Testing algorithm***
To test the BFS algorithm.
1. Run the python script and provide initial and final position of the node within the canvas range.
2. The values must be COMMA-SEPARATED and WITHOUT space.
3. Search algorithm will provide a backtrack path along with time value it took to search the goal node.
